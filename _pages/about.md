I'm a Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student working in the [BRAINML](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home) lab at [Georgia Tech (GT)](https://cse.gatech.edu/) from 2021, advised by [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch/home). I'm very thrilled that I'll take an intern in [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) this summer. I received my B.Eng. honors degree in Software Engineering (Computational Biology) and B.Sc. honors degree in Biological Sciences from [Sichuan University (SCU)](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Yifei Pu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1288/13622.htm) and [Prof. Wei Deng](https://www.hz7hospital.com/bssds/show/id/78.html). I also had an undergraduate exchange experience at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK)](https://www.utk.edu) from 2018 to 2019.

Research interests:
* Computational neuroscience, neural latent variable models, statistical machine learning.
* Eye tracking experiments and data analysis.
* Fractional calculus signal processing.

I play the violin in [Georgia Tech Symphony Orchestra](https://music.gatech.edu/orchestras) since 2023, and I can also play the piano. Outside of research and music, I can perform professional magic tricks and play YOYO ball.
