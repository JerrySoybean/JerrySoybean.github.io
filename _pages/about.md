I'm currently a research scientist at Meta since June 2025, working on neural surface electromyography (sEMG) in Meta's CTRL-Labs. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) with an awarded master degree in Mathematics from [Georgia Tech (GT)](https://cse.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch/home). My undergraduate is from [Wu Yuzhang Honors College, Sichuan University (SCU)](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in computational neuroscience, statistical machine learning, eye tracking experiments, and fractional calculus. The [CV](/cv/) page shows my academic resume, with the [Publications](/publications/) page showing my academic research achievements.

I'm currently a violin player in the [New Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra](https://nasorch.org/) in New York City since the October 2025. Before that I play the violin in [Georgia Tech Symphony Orchestra](https://music.gatech.edu/orchestras) from 2023 to 2025, and I can also play the piano and others.

I started to learn and perform magic tricks since 2009. Currently, I'm a member of the [International Brotherhood of Magicians (I.B.M.)](https://www.magician.org/) and a member of the [Society of American Magicians](https://www.magicsam.com/).

Outside of the above, I also play YOYO ball. Take a look at my [Gallery](/gallery/) for my "out of research" pieces.
